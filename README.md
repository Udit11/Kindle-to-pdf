## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the web application interface.
- **Calibre**: Provides the `ebook-convert` tool for file conversion.
- **Subprocess**: Executes Calibre's command-line tool within the application.

## Troubleshooting
- **Error: `ebook-convert` not found**:
  - Ensure Calibre is installed and the `ebook-convert` executable is in your system's PATH.
  - Alternatively, update `app.py` to use the full path to `ebook-convert.exe`.
- **File Conversion Fails**:
  - Verify that the uploaded file is a valid `.azw3`, `.mobi`, or `.epub` file.
  - Check for sufficient disk space and write permissions in the application directory.
- **Streamlit Not Running**:
  - Confirm that port `8501` is not blocked by another application or firewall.
